        "The first supervised learning algorithm that is going to be seen is the linear regression model, which tends to fit a straight line into your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data set used to train the model is called: training data (input data). The model learns the patterns on the features used to predict the output feature (target) and can gets evaluated with some test data.\n",

        "\n",
        "- x = 'input' variable/feature;\n",
        "- y = 'output' variable/target feature;\n",
        "- m = number of training samples;\n",

        "- First, the training data set is collected;\n",
        "- Then, this data is given to the learning algorithm;\n",
        "- The model tries to build a function $f$ (hypothesis) that descibes the relationship between the input features and the target value, both in the training data set;\n",
        "- With the function created, if another data x is given to the model, it will try to predict some estimator $\\hat{y}$ for the target value for that data. There is a high possibility that $\\hat{y}$ is not 100% correct, it's because of this that it's called an *estimator*.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to represent $f$\n",
        "\n",
        "Fow now, the function $f$ is just going to be linear, so it can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\hat{y} = f_{w, b}(X) = wx + b$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The function above tells us that the estimator of the model will depend of the value of w, b and the input data X. The values of w and b are going to be seen later. Supose that X is a unique variable, so the linear regression is called *univariate* linear regression."
